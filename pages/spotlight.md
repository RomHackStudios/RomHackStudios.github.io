# Spotlight Events

![Adobe_Express_20240106_1015070_1](https://github.com/RomHackStudios/RomHackStudios.github.io/assets/109757010/153360a1-e42e-47f3-b121-e7bd655599af)

- Currently, only the base evo Pokemon are available, i.e., you can generate spotlight events for Pichu and not for Pikachu or Raichu.
- Regional forms aren't available, so are mythical and legendaries but they will be unlocked on special events [you won't have to update your game for them]
- Starting from gen 2 each gen is unlocked with the number of badges you have obtained!
