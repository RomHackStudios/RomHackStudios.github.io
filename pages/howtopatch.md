# How to Patch

To play Pokemon Emerald Crest, you will need to have a Game Boy Advance emulator installed on your device. We recommend using [Mgba](https://mgba.io/downloads.html) for Windows, Linux, and Mac, or [My Boy!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gba) for Android devices.

Once you have downloaded the emulator, follow these steps to play Pokemon Emerald Crest:

## PC

- Download the Pokemon Emerald Crest patch file from [our releases page](https://romhackstudios.github.io/).

- Extract the downloaded file using a program such as [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html).

- Download an original Pokemon Emerald ROM, if you do not already have it.

- Go to [RomPatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/).

- In the `Rom` section, select the original Pokemon Emerald ROM.

- In the `Patch` section, select the extracted Emerald Crest patch file.

- Click on `Apply Patch` and the process is complete âœ… Enjoy the game! ðŸ˜€

{: .note }
> The patch file should end with `.bps` or `.ups` after extraction. If it doesn't, you may have missed a step. Also, after patching the game should end with `.gba`, if it ends with `.txt`, then just remove `.txt` by renaming the file.

## Android/IOS

- Download Pokemon Emerald Crest patch file from [our releases page](https://romhackstudios.github.io/).

- Extract the file you downloaded 

{: .highlight }
> for Android use `zArchiver` to extract it (you can download it from the Play store) and for IOS you can use `WinZip` (you can download it from the App store)

- Download the Original Emerald rom (if you don't have it already)

- Goto https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/

- Choose the original emerald rom in the `Rom` section and choose the extracted Emerald Crest file in the `Patch` section.

- Click on `Apply Patch` and you're done âœ… enjoy the game ðŸ˜€
