# How to Patch

To play Pokemon Emerald Crest, you will need to have a Game Boy Advance emulator installed on your device. We recommend using [Mgba](https://mgba.io/downloads.html) for Windows, Linux, and Mac, or [My Boy!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gba) for Android devices.

Once you have downloaded the emulator, follow these steps to play Pokemon Emerald Crest:

## PC

{: .note }
> The patch file should end with `.bps` or `.ups` after extraction. If it doesn't, you may have missed a step. Also, after patching the game should end with `.gba`, if it ends with `.txt`, then just remove `.txt` by renaming the file.

# How to Update

- Backup Your Save File:

  - Locate your current game ROM file (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.8.5.gba`).
    Make a backup copy of your save file (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.6.sav`). This is to ensure you don't lose your progress.

- Download the Latest Patch: 
  - [Download](https://romhackstudios.github.io/)

- Apply the Patch:

  - Follow the steps as above to apply the patch. [click here](https://romhackstudios.github.io/pages/howtopatch.html#pc)

- Rename Your Save File:

  - After applying the patch and creating a new version of the game, rename your old save file (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.6.sav`) to match the name of the newly patched rom (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.7.sav`).

- Play the Updated Game:

  - Now you can open the newly patched game ROM (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.7.gba`) in your emulato.
   Load your renamed save file (e.g., `EmeraldCrestv1.0.7.sav`) to continue playing from where you left off.
