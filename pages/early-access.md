## Early Access Details

- **Frequency of Updates:** Updates for the `Early Access version` may occur frequently, ranging from daily to weekly releases. However, please note that updates are not guaranteed and may occur less frequently or not at all during certain periods.

- **Stability and Stability Updates:** The `Early Access` version may not be as stable as the final release. While we strive to provide a stable experience, there may be occasional crashes or unforeseen issues. We will release stability updates as necessary to address these problems.
